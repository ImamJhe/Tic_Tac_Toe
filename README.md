## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Tkinter. The game allows a player to play against a computer AI that uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves.

## Requirements

To run the Tic Tac Toe game, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ImamJhe/Tic_Tac_Toe.git
   cd Tic_Tac_Toe
   ```

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Run the Tic Tac Toe game by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python Tic-Tac-Toe.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. Upon running the game, a window will appear, prompting you to choose 'X' or 'O.' Click on the corresponding button to make your choice.

2. The game board will be displayed as a 3x3 grid of buttons.

3. Click on an empty button to place your symbol ('X' or 'O') on the board.

4. The computer AI will automatically make its move after you. Wait for its move before making your next move.

5. The game will continue until either the player or the computer wins, or the board is filled (a draw).

6. After the game ends, a message box will show the Winner or indicate a Draw.

7. If you want to play again, click "Yes" on the "Play Again" button in the message box. Otherwise, close the window to exit the game.
